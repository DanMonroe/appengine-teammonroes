<h3>History</h3>
<p>
A typical Spy vs Spy comic plot would be one spy setting up a booby-trap  for the other to fall into and be "killed". Sometimes the trap works, but sometimes the other spy comes up with a brilliant counter plan of his own (often by watching the spy set up the trap, or just somehow knowing about it) and will be the final winner. However, sometimes the other spy expected this and set up a similar trap for them. In other cases, the losing spy will use a plan B to counter the other spy's counter. Frequently, the winning spy celebrates his victory with a V sign gesture toward the loser.

<p>
Sometimes the spies' traps are not to kill or injure the other, but to simply trick them. Some of the early cartoons (including their very first), published in 1961, had both spies coming up with the same plan to trap the other, the result being a draw. In the early years, the title panel of the comic would feature a one-panel gag presenting one spy besting the other; the main comic then used the rest of the panels to tell a different short story with the other spy winning.

The spies have a new common goal. They want to find a prize hidden by a fiendish enemy.  They must put aside their differences and work together to win the prize. Can you figure out the puzzle and beat them to it?  Good luck!
